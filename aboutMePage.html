						Before the pandemic I was an electrical engineering major at Texas A&M university. 
						At A&M I was a member of the A&M Judo team, even ranking silver in Dallas Invitational National Tournament!
						When the pandemic came through, I had to leave A&M and my team to return home. 
						<br>
						<br>
						While at A&M I excelled at my computer science classes.
						Needing to continue my education I found Thinkful, focusing on software engineering.
						I am excited about working with a team of people to make an idea become reality.
						<br>
						<br>
						This has been an amazing process to learn more about computer engineering. I intend to 
						use my education at Thinkful to become a software engineer, and hopefully start my own
						software engineering firm.
