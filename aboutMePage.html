			<p>
				Before the pandemic I was a electrical engineering major at Texas A&M university. 
				At A&M I was a member of the A&M Judo team, even ranking silver in Dallas Inventaional National Tournament!
				When the pandemic came through I had to leave A&M and my team to return home. 
				<br>
				<br>
				While at A&M I excelled at my computer science classes.
				Needing to continue my education I found Thinkful, focusing on software engineering.
				I am excited about working with a team of people to make an idea become reality.
				<br>
				<br>
				This has been an amazing process to learn more about computer engineering. I intend to 
				use my education at Thinkful to become a software engineer, and hopefully start my own
				software engineering firm.
